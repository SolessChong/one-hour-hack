Overview
========
This project aims to help me get more fans on Zhihu.com. For you who don't know what's Zhihu, it's a copy of Quora.com in Chinese.

Disclaimer
==========
I love Zhihu. I hack something only if I love it.

Purpose
=======
If you don't have enough fans on Zhihu, your answer to a not-so-fresh question will never be seen since your answer will be flushed out by previous ones. Though sometimes those previous answers are useless.
In order to get more "like"s for my answer, I need more fans. Aside from writing answers with good quality, following others will get your more chances to be "followed back". But too many followees will spam your homepage. So I came out with this script.

Functionality
=============
This script follows all the user appears on current webpage and unfollow them immediately. This will send a notice to those users suggesting they have a new follower, although you have already canceled your follow. 
Actually this can either be taken as a bug or not.

Usage
=====
Run this script on your console, whether it is chrome's debugger of firebugs. Don't try to run the file since Zhihu has security mechanisms forbidding remote script, which has caused me a little trouble.

Comments
========
Is this a spamming?
I think maybe yes. However I'm doing it for the good of the community.
I wrote this tool in the hope that high quality users should get more attension, without paying too much extra amount of time to stand out from those trying to be funny.
